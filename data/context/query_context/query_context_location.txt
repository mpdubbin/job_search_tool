I am providing two job postings. In the blocks below, denoted by ####, the provided text correspond to a single job posting and contains pre-parsed HTML tags from the job posting's webpage. It also contains pre-parsed JSON for the job-related details that I'm interested in obtaining. I'm interested in the following job-related details:

- **Job Title**
- **Company Name**
- **Salary** (if available)
- **Location**
- **Office Status** (On-site, Hybrid, Remote)

I've already gone through the webpages, found the relevant HTML tags, and structured the details in JSON format. This is so that you understand the relationship between the HTML and the JSON.

If there is a salary range given, such as $146,900 - $220,300, then $146,900 is the salary_floor and $220,300 is the salary_ceiling.
If there are multiple locations, such as "New York, NY is $98,000 to $131,300 per year and in Santa Monica, CA is $93,400 to $125,200 per year", then output the location and salaries as lists.
