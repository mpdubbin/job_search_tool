About Music & Arts
The first Music & Arts was located in a small house in Bethesda, MD and run by founder Benjamin O'Brien. When Music & Arts opened its doors in 1952, we offered printed music, music lessons, dance lessons, and art supplies. Ben decided shortly after opening his business that he wanted to focus on music to better serve his customers -- a decision that remains intact to this day.
Since the 1990's, Music & Arts has expanded nationwide through organic growth and a series of acquisitions and mergers with other music dealers. In 2005, Music & Arts joined forces with American Music to become the largest band and orchestra instrument retailer in the United States. Based in Frederick, MD, Music & Arts is now part of the Guitar Center enterprise and comprises 200+ retail stores, 120+ educational representatives, and 300+ affiliate locations.
To join our band you will need the following experience:
You bring 3+ years of professional BI, analytics, or related experiences and a team-player attitude, with a demonstrated track record of leading data projects.
Love to convey data stories through reports, visualization and analysis; curious about the “why” behind business performance, and like to drive long-term strategy to influence KPIs.
Have advanced skills in SQL for building multidimensional data tables.
Bring extensive experiences in data visualization tools, preferably Looker or Omni, and building successful, scalable BI data layers.
Take ownership seriously and hold yourself accountable to always deliver in a reliable manner that builds trust. You thrive at a fast pace and managing multiple work streams.
Preferred Experience:
You have effective communication and people skills with the ability to partner with diverse audiences.
You are a curious self-starter, driven to solve problems and find answers. You take charge and flourish when meeting a challenge.
You are excited to ask questions, push boundaries and follow where data leads in pursuit of new opportunities.
You enjoy working in a highly dynamic environment where have a strong voice and your decisions have a significant impact.
Experiences in Tableau, Power BI, and/or SSRS.
R and/or Python skills.
Experiences in producing intuitive and technical report documentation.
Retail and/or music industry knowledge is a plus.
Why Guitar Center? Here's just some of the rewards:

Guitar Center offers robust benefits and perks, including Medical, Dental, Vision, 401K plus company match, mental health support, paid sick/holiday/vacation time, employee discount program, and tuition reimbursement options.
