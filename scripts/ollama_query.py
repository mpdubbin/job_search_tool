{{

    "salary_ceiling": 120000,
    "office_status": "Hybrid",
    "office_location": ["Austin, TX", "San Francisco, CA"]
}}

Rules:

    If salary floor and ceiling are less than 100, assume they are hourly rates and multiply by 2080 to get annual salary.
    If salary data is missing, set it as null instead of 0 or incorrect values.
    Use consistent formatting for "office_status":
        "Remote" (fully remote)
        "Hybrid" (mix of remote & in-office)
        "On-site" (fully in-office)
    Use an array for "office_location", even if there's only one location.

DO NOT include any additional text, explanations, or formattingâ€”ONLY return valid JSON.
